This file is marked for death. 

Its purpose is to learn how to delete a file.

Also, I want to see what a .txt file looks like on GitHub sss
Will line 5 and line 6 appear on the same line in GitHub? 
This is only one way to find out. Strike up the orchestra!

Sorry, file, but I must learn how to delete files, and perhaps a great many of them!
